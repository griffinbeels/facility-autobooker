# Installation

MacOS -- only tested here. This also assumes you're running Python3.7.

1. Create a virtual environment, by running the following in your terminal:
```
./create_venv.sh
```

2. **VERY IMPORTANT** -- run the following after:
```
/Applications/Python\ 3.7/Install\ Certificates.command
```
This will give a valid SSL cert to your requests, which are important for making sure our bot isn't blocked.

3. To run, simply enter:
```
python3.7 signup.py
```
